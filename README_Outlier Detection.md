Data Preprocessing Pipeline
This is a Python function that performs a data preprocessing pipeline to handle missing values and outliers in a given dataset. The function is designed to work with pandas DataFrames and utilizes numpy and scikit-learn libraries.

Requirements
To use this data preprocessing pipeline, you need to have the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip:

Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
Function Description
The data preprocessing pipeline consists of the following steps:

Create a copy of the original DataFrame to avoid modifying the input data.
Identify numeric and categorical features in the DataFrame.
Handle missing values in numeric features by replacing them with the mean of the respective columns.
Detect and handle outliers in numeric features using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Outliers are replaced with the median of the respective columns.
Normalize numeric features using StandardScaler from scikit-learn (currently commented out in the code).
Handle missing values in categorical features by replacing them with the most frequent value in the respective columns.
Usage
To use the data preprocessing pipeline, follow these steps:

Import the required libraries:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
Define the data_preprocessing_pipeline function in your code.

Call the function with the dataset you want to preprocess:

python
Copy code
# Example usage
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Gender': ['Boy'] * 50 + ['Girl'] * 50,
    'Weight': np.concatenate([
        np.random.normal(loc=50, scale=5, size=47),     
        np.random.normal(loc=45, scale=5, size=47),    
        [200, 180, 210],                              
        [35, 30, np.nan],                             
    ])
})

processed_data = data_preprocessing_pipeline(data)
The data_preprocessing_pipeline function will return a DataFrame with missing values and outliers handled according to the specified steps.

Sample Dataset
A sample dataset named data is provided in the usage example above. The dataset contains 'Weight' information for 'Boy' and 'Girl' categories, including some missing values and outlier values.

Notes
Please ensure that you have installed the required libraries before using the function.
The normalization step using StandardScaler is currently commented out. Uncomment it if you want to normalize the numeric features.
The function modifies the input DataFrame only within the scope of the function. It returns a new DataFrame with the preprocessed data, leaving the original data unchanged.
Feel free to use and modify this data preprocessing pipeline according to your specific needs. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy preprocessing! ðŸ˜Š
